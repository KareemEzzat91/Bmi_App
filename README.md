## Getting Started

BMI Calculator App
Project Overview:

The BMI Calculator App is a user-friendly mobile application designed to help individuals assess their body mass index (BMI) and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Developed using Flutter, this app provides a seamless, cross-platform experience on both iOS and Android devices. The app allows users to quickly input their height and weight, calculate their BMI, and receive personalized feedback based on their results.

Key Features:

Intuitive User Interface: Designed with a clean, modern UI, the app ensures a smooth user experience with easy navigation and clear visual elements.

BMI Calculation: Users can input their height and weight to calculate their BMI. The app supports both metric (cm/kg) and imperial (inches/lbs) units.

Personalized Feedback: After calculating the BMI, users receive detailed information about their BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) along with health tips.

History Tracking: Users can track their BMI over time by saving previous entries and viewing their historical data through a graphical timeline.

Unit Conversion: Users can switch between metric and imperial units easily, catering to diverse preferences.

Data Storage: The app securely stores user data locally on the device, ensuring privacy and easy access to past records.

Responsive Design: Built with Flutter's responsive design principles, the app provides an optimal experience on various screen sizes and orientations.

Error Handling: Includes input validation and error messages to guide users in providing accurate data and preventing calculation errors.
